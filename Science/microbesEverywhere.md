# Microbes in the air and underground
Look around. No matter where you are, you are surrounded by life. No, I don’t mean just the people or pets or plants that may be near you. The stuff you can see is just a fraction of the living world you inhabit. The vast majority of the life around you is invisible. We tend to forget about things we can't see, ignoring that which is literally under our noses, but it’s there.

Life is incredibly tenacious, fighting for and keeping its niche in just about environment it encounters. In the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth, there are lifeforms. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can’t see them, but small doesn’t mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it is clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think. 

Every traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like “spirit” or “life force”, sometimes with more expressive terms like “angels”, “demons”, “gods” or even, simply, “God”. Sometimes the more serious people dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that’s not quite true either. With the right instruments, we *can* see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden.

The invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us incredible, rich, living universes waiting to be explored.

Microbes in the sky
---
One place to look is up: scientists at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France for decades have been sampling clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: they find plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount [you’d find in alpine snow](http://www.livescience.com/26645-microbes-in-the-sky.html). Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate. [^1]

The upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again.

These extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, *Pseudomonas syringae*, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky.

Our inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there. Traces of plankton, for example, have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere. [^2] Why?! How did they get there! Who knows!

Scientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered *Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator* by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.[^3] Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same *Firmicutes* phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there.

Subglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. [A careful underground bore hole](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7514/full/nature13667.html) inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found more than 4,000 different species of bacteria surviving under that ice. The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources.[^4]

Those may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole[^5] found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life.

There are even microbes that thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. *Deinococcus radiodurans* is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human.
