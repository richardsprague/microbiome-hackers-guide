Experimenting Across Multiple Samples
==========================================

Microbe numbers shift daily in response to your environment, so a single sample won’t give much more than a broad introduction to the basics of your microbiome. To understand the results of a given test, you’ll soon want to compare it to other samples, either from yourself at a different point in time, or to other people. This chapter will give examples for how to do that.

[Experiment 1: Food](/experiment-food.md) Can I learn anything if carefully record all the food I ate between two tests a week apart?

[Experiment 2: Travel](/experiment-jungleTravel.md) I tested myself before and after a trip to Central America. What changed?

[Experiment 3: Hacking My Sleep](/experiment-sleep.md) Can I improve my sleep by feeding the right microbes?

[Experiment 4: The Dentist](/experiment-dentist.md) What changes before and after my dental checkup?

[Experiment 5: Gut Cleanse](/experiment-colon.md) Let's go all the way: clear out all the microbes and watch how they grow back.
