# Introduction
During the period from 2014 until late 2017, we sequenced over 500 near-daily samples of the microbiome of a single individual. Replicating the experiment in @david_host_2014, we carefully tracked diet, sleep, location, activity, and other variables. Most samples were from gut, but bimonthly samples were regularly taken of skin, nose, and mouth as well.
