## How to get microbiome data

The most popular laboratory is the San Francisco startup uBiome ^[from September 2012], 
that originally began as crowdfunded campaign on
Indiegogo^[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubiome-sequencing-your-microbiome], but has since handled tens of thousands of samples from people like me who are curious to know what a 16S analysis will reveal about their own microbiome. For less than \$100, you send them a sample and a few weeks later they give you access to a private web page that will show you a breakdown of the types of bacteria they found.

Another crowdsourced testing service is American Gut. ^[which dates from [November 2012](https://domains.google.com/registrar?s=americangut&hl=en#st=a&chp=w&w=americangut.org) ]

### DayTwo
Another new microbiome health company is [DayTwo](https://daytwo.com). Based on more than five years of highly-cited academic research^[Published in [Cell](http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)01481-6) by @zeevi_personalized_2015] by Prof. Eran Segal and Prof. Eran Elinav from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, their app uses a metagenomic sequencing of your gut microbiome to tell which foods are good for you. It took them about two months to process my samples, after which my iPhone can tell me which foods are better or worse for my health.


### Gencove

Another company offering microbiome (and other genomic) testing is Gencove.



I'll skip the details of how to collect the sample, and assume that you've done that already. Now on to the analysis.
