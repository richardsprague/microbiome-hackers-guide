The Science of the Microbiome
=============================
[this chapter is a stub]

Microbes are everywhere.

The word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. The vast majority of microbes are bacteria, though viruses and phages fit this description too, as well as archaea, the extremophile life forms that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria.

Because they’re so small, we normally don’t think much about microbes, but they are absolutely everywhere on earth.

Scientists have known since Pasteur times that our bodies and environment are awash in other species, microbial bystanders that seem to grow everywhere. But the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes.

The old technique for studying the microbial life around us required taking a sample, inserting it into a culture of some nutrient broth known to be good for breeding microbes, and waiting a few days to see what grows (or doesn’t). That’s still a common way to study microbes, and that couple-of-day incubation period is one reason you don’t get your lab tests back for a few days.

Now, thanks to new machines originally developed for mass DNA sequencing, the process of finding and understanding microbes has been revolutionized. It’s now possible to search for new life forms without growing them in a culture, and this has made possible a major shift in how to think about life —and what is important and special about human hardware.
Unlike the genetic discoveries you can make by understanding your DNA (from a low-cost consumer service like 23andme), much of the news from the microbial world is actionable. There’s little, if anything, you can do if you find you have a particular type of gene that gives you, say, a propensity to alzheimers for example. But because the microbes around you are constantly changing anyway, and because you can influence which ones grow and which don’t, the world of the human micro biome is eminently actionable.

These microbes are so numerous that they affect the climate. 

Traces of plankton have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere.

There are even microbes that thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.




Subglacial Lake Whillans is a lake found under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. A careful underground bore hole was inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7514/full/nature13667.html]  and found more than 4,000 different species of bacteria surviving under the ice. The total bacterial count was not that different from the count you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources.

Nowhere are the microbes more numerous or obvious than in our guts. The tiny bacteria that come sliding down your inner tube eventually exit the body entirely, in a pile you’ve been making anew every day since your birth. Later we’ll show you how to analyze these exiting microbes, but first, because the gut is such an important home to microbes, let’s go into more detail about the journey they take from mouth to rear.

#Food and microbes
Start with the food itself. Even the most preservative- and chemical-laden substance that people actually eat will have had microbes present at some point. Plants are covered with them. Unless microbes are present in the soil where the crop is planted, nothing will come of the seeds. The relationship between soil bacteria and plants is a complicated and understudied one, but what is known is that every plant hosts its own unique species of microbe in a symbiotic relationship as tight as any on earth. The microbes tangled in the roots of a corn or wheat plant, for example, are highly specific to that particular strain. Alter one of the microbes, or — worse — sterilize the soil, and the plant can’t take advantage of the nutrients sitting right at hand, but in a form that is useless until acted upon by microbes.
After harvest and processing, our meals still contain a surprising variety of microbes. Of course, sometimes this is deliberate: some of us eat fermented foods like sauerkraut or yogurt deliberately to ingest the microbes that were grown to make their special flavor or texture. But even every day foods, like 
We eat plants for their nutrients, but often a “nutrient” is in the eye of the beholder. Plants don’t like to be eaten any more than the rest of us, and they have developed powerful defense mechanisms to prevent invasion by the wrong types of microbes.

#Your Appendix

Somewhere near the border between the small intestine and the large intestine (colon), there is a small, pinkie-like appendage bulging inconspicuously into the abdominal cavity. For most of the period of modern western medicine, nobody knew its function, other as a source of severe pain when it occasionally exploded in infections that until the development of antibiotics were usually fatal.

Appendicitis used to be very rare (3-4 cases/year till 1890, up to 113 by 1918), which was fortunate, because there was no treatment. It was a sad fact that, for example the only death among the hundred or so frontiersmen and explorers on the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800s was caused by appendicitis — a terrible, painful death in the wilderness but one that would have been just as inevitable at the finest hospitals in the world at the time.

What’s known is that the appendix apparently houses three things: tissue from the immune system, a bunch of what are called IgA antibodies that fight infections, and tons of bacteria. What’s also known is that people who have their appendix removed surgically — usually as a result of one of those terrible infections — recover to live apparently normal lives, with no side effects even decades upon decades later. So what is the appendix doing?
One clue comes from a recent study of 254 patients recovering from a C. Difficil infection, a horridly tenacious bacterium that has gained near-complete resistance to antibiotics and is notoriously difficult to treat. In the study, those with an appendix saw their infections come back 11% of the time, but those with no appendix suffered re-infection rates of 44% — a large and significant difference that has caused most scientists to speculate that the appendix is harboring something that enables the body to recover after a microbial disaster.

My own interest in this subject is not idle curiosity. About fifty years ago, doctors at a small town hospital gave an appendectomy to my five-year-old self in order to treat an unusual belly ache. While doing what was apparently an exploratory surgery to find the cause, they came upon my otherwise healthy-looking appendix and decided on the spot to simply remove it. “Why not?” I’m sure they thought at the time. “If nothing else, it’ll prevent him from appendicitis”, which is as tautologically sound a reason as any.
Did that change me, somehow? Am I fundamentally different because for most of my life I’ve been missing an important microbe safety zone that the rest of you enjoy? Science doesn’t know the answers, and even when there are studies based on well-conducted experiments, I can’t know the answer unless I do the experiment on me. [Hint: that’s exactly what I did: see Chapter 3]





Microbes of the Skin
--------------------
Microbes of the gut are important, but many other organisms are crawling all over you too.
It should be no surprise that the most obvious place for them to live is on your outside: your skin and hair. We usually think of bacteria, fungi, or viruses, as something to eradicate, pests that can only be there to cause problems. The natural state of the body is pristinely washed: clean, with no dirt or other blemishes.

This pristine state has never been true. Humans, like all other multi-celled creatures, have lived forever in a bath of foreign ride-hitchers of all types. This micro-fauna is as natural to us as the air we breath, and like air, our bodies need a good environment to be at our best.

The body maintains its temperature well, occasionally cooling itself off by channeling excess water through the sweat glands and onto the surface of the skin. Besides water, this sweat contains small amounts of other matter, including elements that toss molecules into the air, many of which, upon landing on the olfactory glands of another person will be sensed as a smell — an odor, body odor. 
Nature does not like waste, especially not anything associated with a living body like us, and as soon as those micro elements in sweat are exposed to the air, in the natural state there will be other lifeforms available to devour them, taking out some of the leftover energy in the process of converting them to simpler chemical compounds like carbon dioxide.


One such hanger-on, is the bacterium *Nitrosomonas eutropha*. It thrives in your skin and makes a living from oxidizing, that is, converting to oxygen, the ammonia that is naturally present in the waste secreted by your sweat glands.


Microbes and the Brain
-----------------------
We don’t normally pay much attention to the role that microbes play in our daily lives, other than as an annoyance that occasionally makes us sick. But the more that scientists uncover, the more it becomes clear that something this old and ubiquitous is not nearly as hands-off as we think.

[Examples of microbes that can affect the brain ]

Microbes can change the brain’s personality
*Toxoplasma Gondii* is a tiny microbe that, for some reason, only likes to reproduce from within the gut of a cat. It can be found in almost all warm-blooded mammals, including humans — about 30% of us, according to some estimates, and that’s after a century of obsession with hygiene that has wiped out countless other tiny inhabitants of the body.
T. Gondii seem harmless because its hosts appear to show no differences before or after “infection” except in one creature: the mouse. When it finds itself ingested by a mouse, it appears to fade away quietly. MRI scans show large amounts in the gut for a week or two, gradually decreasing until there is apparently nothing. Except: tiny T. Gondii cysts begin to show up in the mouse’s brain. Not everywhere, but in just a few strategic places.
Then something strange happens: the mouse is suddenly attracted to cat urine. And note: its only attraction is to cat urine, not rabbits, not humans — only cats. Everything else about the mouse appears normal. It still seems to be afraid of the other things that scare mice: other predators, stressful situations. But put a T. Gondii-affected mouse into a maze with different animal urine in the corners and it will rush to the cat side every time.

How is it that T. Gondii is able to be so precise in its effects? It only seems to affect mice, and even then it only apparently makes them attracted to cats. It doesn’t apparently cause any other harm to its hosts, so — somehow — it must have found a resting place right at the spot in the mouse brain that affects its interest in cats.

Although there doesn’t seem to be any major negative consequences to humans hosting T. Gondii, some scientists aren’t sure. One man in particular, Jaroslav Flegr, an evolutionary biologist at Charles University in Prague, thinks he has evidence that women who carry it might be more trusting than those who don’t. 
Incidentally, some of the drugs used to treat schizophrenia have been shown [ Jones-Brando]to reduce levels of T. Gondii. 

T.Gondii isn’t the only microbe known to affect the behavior of its host. A more common example is the rabies virus, which upon infection somehow causes a mammal to be more agitated, more likely to strike out — or bite — other humans, thereby spreading itself.

Or syphilus, the disease spread by the bacterium [syphilius] and causes its host to go insane. The microbe is somehow able to infect the mind of the victim.

In general, sexually transmitted diseases are especially likely to have behavioral consequences. A sexual disease that produces symptoms is unlikely to spread, yet it still requires contact with a new victim. Perhaps the ideal vector is a behavioral change, making the host more likely to come in contact with a new host.

numerous pathogens have been associated with mental illnesses, including Borna disease virus, Epstein-Barr and certain strains of herpes, including varicella zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles.[ http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/10/25/451169292/could-depression-be-caused-by-an-infection
]

Think about this too much, and you'll end up with the obvious question: what other weird microbes are infecting us right now? Can we explain some of our own behaviors this way? Is there a human equivalent of these infections, driving us to do things we “ordinarily” wouldn't do? And maybe these microbes are so ubiquitous, teeming all over us and in our brains, maybe there's no way to even know what “ordinary” or “normal” human behavior is.
