# The Microbiome Hackers Guide

This is a brief excerpt of a book for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology who want to learn the basics of the human microbiome in a hands-on, practical way — by experimenting on yourself. By practicing with your own examples, you’ll learn how to study and manipulate the microbes inside you.
