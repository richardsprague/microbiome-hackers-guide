# The Microbiome Hackers Guide

This is a very, very early draft excerpt of a book for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology who want to learn the basics of the human microbiome in a hands-on, practical way — by experimenting on yourself. We assume you have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable installing and running common applications like Excel.  By practicing with your own examples, you’ll learn how to study and manipulate the microbes inside you.

Here are the main sections:

* Getting Started: What to look for in your first uBiome results.
* Explore the Raw Data: Download your results for deeper analysis.
* The Science: Learn more background about the microbiome
* Experiments: Examples of self-experimenting
* Next Steps: Take your knowledge to the next level

By the end of the book, you will be well on your way to a hands-on understanding of one of the most exciting areas at the frontier of biology.
