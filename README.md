# The Microbiome Hackers Guide
This book is for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology who want to learn the basics of the human microbiome in a hands-on, practical way — by experimenting on yourself. We assume you have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable installing and running common applications like Excel.  By practicing with your own examples, you’ll learn how to study and manipulate the microbes inside you.
