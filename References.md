This is a new field, so much of the written literature remains in academia, but hopefully the following summary of items to read will be helpful.

Here are my suggestions for additional reading.

General about the Microbiome
----------------------------

*The Diet Myth: Why the Secret to Health and Weight Loss is Already in Your Gut* Tim Spector

*Missing Microbes* by Martin Blaser

*10% Human: How Your Body's Microbes Hold the Key to Health and Happiness* Alanna Collen

*Follow Your Gut: How the Ecosystem in Your Gut Determines Your Health, Mood, and More* by Rob Knight

*The Wild Life of Our Bodies* by Rob Dunn


*An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases* Velasquez
by Manoff, Moises

Another book that explains a provocative idea that our immune systems need regular stimulation by parasites and other infectious agents, or we risk unpleasant side effects in the form of allergies, diabetes, and many other nasty conditions. The remarkable correlation between the hygiene of modernity and the rise of autoimmune diseases makes for powerful evidence that science is far behind in understanding all the consequences of our current lifestyles.

Practical

*Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Life Culture Foods* by Sandor Katz



Not Recommended
===============

Life is short, so sometimes it’s nice to have a list of books marked “don’t bother.”

*The Microbiome Diet* by Raphael Kellman Includes the typical formulaic suggestions for how to cure a bad microbiome (Remove! Replace! Reinoculate! Repair!) and lots of sweeping, unproven suggestions for what to eat: “Cinnamon balances blood sugar” with absolutely nothing to connect it to the microbiome. There is a nice list of “superfoods” including natural prebiotics like jicama, but again you must take his word for it that this somehow benefits the microbiome. Just google it and save the effort.
