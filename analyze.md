Get Your Data
=============

Your first step is to get some data. The most popular laboratory is a San Francisco startup called uBiome, that originally began as an Indiegogo campaign, but has since handled tens of thousands of samples from people like me who are curious to know what a 16S analysis will reveal about their own microbiome. For less than \$100, you send them a sample and a few weeks later they give you access to a private web page that will show you a breakdown of the types of bacteria they found.
